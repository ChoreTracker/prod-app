	<H1>A Visit by St. Nicolas</H1>
	<h2>'Twas the night before Christmas</h2>
	<h3>and all through the house. Not a </h3>
	<h4>creature was stirring...</h4>
	<h5>not even a mouse.</h5>
	<h6>!</h6>
	<p>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds; While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,</p>
	<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
	Gave a lustre of midday to objects below, </p>
	<p>When what to my wondering eyes did appear, But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,</p>
